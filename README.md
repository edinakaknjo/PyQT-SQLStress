# PyQT SQLStress

This application was developed as part of the **Master’s degree coursework in Software Engineering**,  
for the course **Database Optimization**, supervised by **Prof. Denis Čeke**.

---

## Background
For initial query testing, the well-known open-source C# tool **[SQLQueryStress](https://github.com/ErikEJ/SqlQueryStress/releases)** was used.  
That application served as the starting idea and reference point.  

The goal of this project was to recreate its functionality using **Python (PyQt5)** and extend it further with additional features.

---

## Features
- Reimplementation of the original **SQLQueryStress** functionality in Python.  
- Added **CPU performance monitoring** during query stress tests (new functionality not present in the original app).  
- The rest of the features replicate the original application, but implemented in a different programming language.  
- The user interface of the application is in **English**.
